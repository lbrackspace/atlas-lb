Requirements
------------
  Java >= 1.5
  Apache Maven == 2.2.1 (Use settings from settings.xml file located in config/maven)
  Apache ActiveMQ == 5.5.0
  Glassfish >= 3.1
  MySql
 
Getting Started
---------------
  mvn clean install
     - creates public-war-packager/target/atlas-public-rest-service-x.y.z-SNAPSHOT.war

  Create a database called 'loadbalancing' using the schema under config/db/loadbalancing_schema.sql
  Create a database called 'loadbalancing_usage' using the schema under config/db/loadbalancing_usage_schema.sql

  Seed the 'loadbalancing' database with sample data, using the file under config/db/loadbalancing_seed.sql

  Follow the steps in article below to create 2 mysql datasources in glassfish application server. These are the datasources used by the application to connect to the databases:
       http://www.albeesonline.com/blog/2008/08/06/creating-and-configuring-a-mysql-datasource-in-glassfish-application-server/

       1. For the step 1 of that article, download the latest version of Mysql JDBC driver ie. 5.0.8 version.
       2. For the first data source pointing to database loadbalancing, in the step 17 of that article, name the jndi name as jdbc/loadBalancerDB.
       3. For the second  data source pointing to database loadbalancing_usage, in the step 17 of that article, name the jndi name as jdbc/loadBalancerUsageDB.

  Copy files under config/etc/openstack/atlas and put them under your /etc/openstack/atlas directory.

  Start ActiveMQ on default port.

  Deploy the lb-public-rest-service-x.y.z-SNAPSHOT.war under the atlas directory public-war-packager/target to Glassfish, choosing
  "/v1.0" as the Context Root

  Now you can access the Atlas REST APIs on port http://<hostname>:8080/v1.0/<tenant_id>/<resource>

  For more info on the Atlas REST API, see the "RackSpace Cloud Load Balancers API 1.0" at http://docs.rackspacecloud.com/loadbalancers/api/v1.0/clb-devguide/content/Overview-d1e82.html.
   For OpenStack project Atlas, see https://launchpad.net/atlas-lb for now!
