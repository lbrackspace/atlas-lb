      "message": "During debuggin I noticed that all validators were being reconstructed on ever getValidator() pass but only one is returned. I set this to construct the new validator based on the instance of the class being requested cause it was slowing me down during debugging and its save a tone of instruction execution. See how the map is being rebuilt on the left during every execution. A new Validator is needed to be thread safe but we don\u0027t need to rebuild all of them.",
