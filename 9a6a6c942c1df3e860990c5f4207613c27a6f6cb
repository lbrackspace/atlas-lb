      "message": "FYI the parens around token are not required -- python actually just removes them as redundant if you make a tuple with a single element. If you want to actually use a tuple, it\u0027d be (token,) to keep python from eating them. Fortunately, % substitution works with a tuple or a single element so it doesn\u0027t matter. Just useful information for the future. :P",
