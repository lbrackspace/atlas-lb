      "message": "I think what you want to do is validate whether a user is trying to enable logging on a load balancer that has a UDP protocol and if so, throw a bad request exception. I don\u0027t think we care what it actually is in the database. Likewise, if connection logging is enabled and the user changes the protocol from a non-UDP protocol to a UDP protocol we should also throw a bad request exception asking them to disable connection logging first. Thoughts?",

Will remove after you mentioned that an audit would be made to check for this before going live. The other checks you asked for are made in LoadBalancerServiceImpl.java (also in this change).",
