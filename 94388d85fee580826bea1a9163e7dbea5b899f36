Because, assuming we map the correct \u0027current\u0027 nodes (not the doomed ones) it should Update as expected. I dont\u0027 see a reason for us to remove the nodes from cpool. Though its been a while and would need to be tested.",

      "message": "If I remember correctly, when we update other resources the translation of other resources need to happen. This could probably cleaned up by having the translator update everything, but would probably require quite a bit of rework.
