Because, assuming we map the correct \u0027current\u0027 nodes (not the doomed ones) it should Update as expected. I dont\u0027 see a reason for us to remove the nodes from cpool. Though its been a while and would need to be tested.",

      "message": "Well, from looking at this, it seems it is removing the FIRST node that\u0027s marked for deletion from the cPool, setting the nodes on the LB correctly (based on the calculation above), then re-translating the cPool before updating the ZXTM host. So I believe the two lines below are essentially doing *nothing*. I am going to remove them as part of this CR in my next patchset.",

This could probably cleaned up by having the translator update everything, but would probably require quite a bit of rework. I would honestly suggest for us to go back through all of this if we do indeed want to go live with it. There is definitely some quarks to this monstrosity i conjured up.",
