The tools provided here are designed to take in a directory containing JSON schemas for the Stingray/Brocade product.

Usage: python jsupdate.py schema/directory datamap True

jsupdate will take in the schema directory which contains other schema directories.
datamap is a mapping file between the directory and the desired javaType.
cleanup is a way to remove unwanted files from the schema directory. Set to True to clean up.

Format:
      Schemas directories should be top level to the directory provided in the args. Sub directories that are not
      valid schema directories are ignored. Some special case directories like 'util', 'exception' and 'list' are allowed.

      Datamap must contain a dictionary mapping of the directory name, ex. 'config-pool' or 'counters-virtual-server'
      to the desired javaType and namespace. Ex: "config-pool": "org.rackspace.stingray.pojo.pool.Pool"

Make a backup of the schema directory.

Once the files have been converted, the directory containing the schemas should be placed in the resource package of
stingray-rest-client in order for proper generation of the pojos.
